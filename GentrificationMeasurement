Gentrification Measurement Steps

-identify which ones meet the minimum requirement...
        -the following is Rucks-Ahidiana's method, written under
        (WR_Memo_04.02.24):
            -Gentrifiable tracts: Tracts must have:
•	a percentage increase in proportion of college educated residents or a percentage increase in mean family income 

•	a percentage change increase in average housing value or rental costs. 

•	percentage changes need to be at least half standard deviation more than changes in the Metropolitan Statistical Area (MSA)

            -Become gentrified when:
            Tracts become gentrified if there is an increase in education or income
(either as Marginal, Income, Super-Gentrification)

based on this here are the steps:

*how do i deal with weighting though?*
  -don't need to weight because units of analysis are tracts
1) Find California tracts
2) start with the year 2000 average
3) Average out 2016-2018 for college educated residents, mean family income
   Housing value or rental costs
4) Subtract the "2017" by 2000 to calculate percentage changes
4) Find out the average changes for all the MSA
5) Calculate percentage change, which would be the difference between the 
new and old year then divide by old year value then + 1 (double check)
6) Compare tract percent changes to MSA, these should be at least half standard
deviation change (so need to figure that out) then these will be the gentrifiable tracts
